                There are many locally owned businesses, and as such, the town largely supports other new, local businesses. There are a large variety of 
                people and interests so Galt is the perfect place for any new business.</p>

            <p>For example, if a new family moves into town and want to start a junk removal business, they could reach out to the Galt Chamber of Commerce
                to learn about more opportunities, when monthly meetings are, or how to become a member. Galt Chamber of Commerce is looking for ambitious 
                people looking to improve themselves and their community.</p>
