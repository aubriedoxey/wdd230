            <p class="audience-info">The target audience for this website is members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and those who have an interest in learning
                about the church and its temples. The focus is to inform people of the services and amenities available for people wishing to visit the temple. There are potentially
                many obstacles that prevent people from being able to attend the temple. This website is designed to help people recognize how they can overcome those obstacles. 
            </p>

            <img class= "working-man" src="images/working-man.jfif" alt="Picture of business owning man">
            <p>For example, there are many worthy, temple recommend holding members who find it difficult to attend the temple due to young children or distance from a temple. Through
                advertising some of the services we offer such as childcare and housing accommodations, we can help people attend the temple.
            </p>
            <p>People who are not member can also use this as a way to learn and understand more about the Church through staying in our hotels.</p>
